    <h2>üìñ Step-by-Step PvP Guide</h2>

    <div class="guide-step">
      <h3>Step 1: Choose Your Build</h3>
      <p>Step 1: Choose your build. Your build is crucial in reaching 30 million bounty. Without a proper build, you will not be able to PvP well if you are still a beginner. A build I would recommend for a beginner, is gravity cane, godhuman, portal, skull guitar, and either angel v4 or ghoul v4. Angel v4 is for the stun and how difficult it makes you to combo them, and ghoul v4 is for the insane cooldown reduction and regeneration. I‚Äôd recommend a balanced build without being too much spam or too much skilled, something like portal (without spamming v move or c move) or ice (some people call it spam but good for combos).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="guide-step">
      <h3>Step 2: Learn Combos</h3>
      <p>Step 2. Now that you‚Äôve chosen your build, you need to learn combos. For a beginner, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend one shot combos. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù you may ask? Well it‚Äôs because one shot combos are usually harder to learn then other combos since many players who know how to kentrick can easily kentrick the combo before it does any real damage. Additionally, if you miss your one shot combo then most of your moves will be on cooldown which makes you vulnerable. So if your a beginner, it‚Äôs recommended to learn techs, (mini combos that are easier to land). But if you are in the intermediate levels or higher one shot combos will become better and more useful for you as you gradually improve. Some good fruits for combos is ice, dough, kitsune or even portal.  </p>
    </div>

    <div class="guide-step">
      <h3>Step 3: Master Kentrick</h3>
      <p>Use Instinct only to dodge crucial moves. Learn when attacks cancel instinct. For example, when a player uses shark anchor z, it cancels out the instinct. On the other hand, when he uses shark anchor x, you can dodge it. Since kentrick isn‚Äôt supposedly a ‚Äúskill‚Äù it‚Äôs recommended for you to memorize all the skills that turn off your instinct or you can dodge with. Or if not, you can just keep pvping over and over again, and you‚Äôll learn eventually.
